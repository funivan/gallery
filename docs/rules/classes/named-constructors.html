Class :: Named Constructors

Named constructors are static methods that begins with the word "create"
and always return new instance of the class.

There can be several named constructors.

We should make __construct method private when we add at least one named constructor.

Named constructors should have return type declaration which correspond to the interface of this class

For example:
<code>
  class User implements UserInterface {
    private $name;
    private function __construct(string $name) {
      $this->name = $name;
    }
    public static function createFromData(array $data) : UserInterface{
      return new self($data['name']);
    }
    public static function createFromFile(FileInterface $file) : UserInterface {
      return new self(trim($file->read());
    }
    // ...
  }
</code>
